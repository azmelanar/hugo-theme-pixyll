Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).
Based on [Pixyll for Jekyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll)

Example config:

```toml
languageCode = "en-us"
contentdir = "content"
publishdir = "public"
builddrafts = false
baseUrl = ""
canonifyurls = true
title = "Pixyll"
author = "admin"
theme = "pixyll"
disqusShortname = "sitename"

[indexes]
  category = "categories"
  tag = "tags"

[params]
  search_engine = true
  google_analytics_id = "XX-XXXXXXXX-X"
  twitter_username = "username"
  paginate = true
```

## Search
We decided to use [Tipue Search](http://www.tipue.com/search/) with custom script
to generate index. Search is being done completely in browser, you don't need to
run webserver for search. Current version of Tipue Search is 7.0

To activate search ensure that `[params]` section has line `search_engine = true`.
Then you need to generate search index:
1. Copy script `create_search_index.py` to your website root location,
where `config.toml` is located.
1. Install python requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run `python2 create_search_index.py`

Script was tested with python 2.7 only.

Index will be placed into `public/tipuesearch/tipuesearch_content.js`. Every time you add
new article you need to regenerate index with command above.
If you run hugo as a server, please append option `--renderToDisk` othervise hugo
will not pick up files generated by search script.
